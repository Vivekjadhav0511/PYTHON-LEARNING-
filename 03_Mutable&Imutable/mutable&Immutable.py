""" 
Mutable
A variable or object that can be changed after it's created. For example, you can add, remove, or modify the contents of a mutable list or dictionary.
Immutable
A variable or object that cannot be changed after it's created. For example, you can't change the value of an immutable int, float, bool, complex, string, tuple, or set. 

Here are some other differences between mutable and immutable objects in Python:

Memory usage: Mutable objects are more memory-intensive than immutable objects because 
they store a copy of their contents whenever they are changed. 

#Error-proneness: Immutable objects are less prone to errors than mutable objects. 

# Creating new objects: When you change an immutable object, Python creates a new 
object with a different memory allocation.  """
